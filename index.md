I am an incoming Assistant Professor in the Marquette University Department of Political Science. I study integration, housing politics and policy, poverty, and inequality, focusing on the role of housing policies and practices in fostering equitably integrated communities. Prior to my appointment at Marquette University, I served as a Post-Doctoral Associate in the Ralph W. Voorhees Center for Civic Engagement and the Center for State Health Policy at Rutgers University. I received my Ph.D. in Population Studies and Social Policy from Princeton University in 2024 and my B.A. in Economics and Political Science from the University of Notre Dame in 2015. 

Through my research, I study how housing policies and practices that promote integration can alleviate poverty, advance equity, improve intergroup relations, and nurture social cohesion within and across communities. I also study how to increase political support for these kinds of policies and practices. I have published research on neighborhood ethnoracial and socioeconomic integration and exclusionary zoning, including the National Zoning and Land Use Database, an open-source initiative to make zoning and land use data accessible and available for the public. My ongoing work includes these topics as well as fair housing, homelessness, the connection between housing and school integration, refugee integration, and others. See my Research page for more information.

I have two teaching passions: (1) the fundamental role of housing (and related urban and regional planning priorities) in the formation of our communities and politics and (2) the application of probability and statistics to think critically about complex policy issues and to carry out rigorous quantitative research. At Marquette University, I will teach undergraduate and graduate courses in quantiative research methods and housing politics and policy. Previously, in addition to courses like these, I have also taught courses in health policy. See my Teaching page for more information.

I consider community engagement core to my work. I have extensive experience engaging in meaningful policy efforts and community initiatives which informs my research and teaching. This includes public service, leading a pro-housing volunteer advocacy group, public testimony at the local and state level, participation in various policy and advocacy initiatives, and community-engaged research and teaching projects. See my Community Engagement page for more information.
